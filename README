NAME
    MooX::Singleton - turn your Moo class into singleton

VERSION
    version 1.20

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp;
        use Moo;
        with 'MooX::Singleton';

        package main;

        my $instance = MyApp->instance(@optional_init_args);
        my $same = MyApp->instance;

DESCRIPTION
    Role::Tiny role that provides "instance" method turning your object into
    singleton.

METHODS
  instance
        my $singleton = MyApp->instance(@args1);
        my $same = MyApp->instance;
        # @args2 are ignored
        my $above = MyApp->instance(@args2);

    Creates a new object initialized with arguments provided and then
    returns it.

    NOTE: Subsequent calls to "instance" will return the singleton instance
    ignoring any arguments. This is different from MooseX::Singleton which
    does not allow any arguments.
